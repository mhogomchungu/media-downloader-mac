Below are instructions on how to build SiriKali on MacOS.

1.  Clone SiriKali repository with the following command:
    git clone https://github.com/mhogomchungu/sirikali.git

    When you run git the first time on MacOS, you will be prompted to install developer tools (which includes git) and be guided through it.
    
    1b. Go to the cloned folder:
    cd sirikali
    
2.  Install homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

3.  # Install dependencies with brew:
    brew install libgcrypt qt5 pkg-config cmake

4.  # Install Macfuse
    brew install --cask macfuse

5.  If your chosen encrypted filesystem is not installed select one (or more) of the following: 

    # Easy alternative to install all 3:
    brew install gromgit/fuse/gocryptfs-mac gromgit/fuse/encfs-mac  gromgit/fuse/securefs-mac

6.  # You need to specify the path to the qt5 you installed through homebrew:
    echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc; source ~/.zshrc
    
    6b. Tell cmake where to find qt:
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qt@5/5.15.5/

7.  # Create a build diretory and cd into it
    mkdir build; cd build

8.  # Then you'll be able to compile Sirikali to $HOME/sirikali
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/sirikali -DQT5=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..

9.  # Compile using all available logical cores
    make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)

10. # Run make install
    make install

11. "install" SiriKali by just dragging it (in the Finder) from the directory you compiled it in to the "Application" directory.

Note:
If you encounter errors such as:

/usr/local/include/QtCore/qglobal.h:667:43: error: no template named 'is_arithmetic_v' in namespace 'std'; did you mean
      'is_arithmetic'?
         typename = std::enable_if_t<std::is_arithmetic_v<T> && std::is_arithmetic_v<U> &&

You will need to unlink QT6 to get things to compile: brew unlink qt6

*****************************************************************************************************

Available build options:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/sirikali
This option tells the build process to install project's files in "$HOME/sirikali".

This option tells the build process to build the project in release mode.This mode is most suitable for non developers.

-DNOSECRETSUPPORT=false
This option tells the build process to add gnome's libsecret secure storage of passwords.Set this option to "true" if
you do not want libsecret's support.

-DINTERNAL_LXQT_WALLET=false
This project depends on lxqt_wallet project and it ships with an internal copy of the project. Set this option to "true"
if you want SiriKali to unconditionally use the internal copy of the project or to "false" to make the build process
use a system installed version if found.
