This tool depends on the following packages installed to build, their precise name may differ in your distro.

Look in "debian.upstream" folder for information on how to build a debian package.

3. For Qt4 build(libqt4-devel or a package that provides libqt4-network-devel,libqtcore4-devel,libqtgui4-devel)
   For Qt5 build(qt5-base-devel or a packages that provides Qt5Core-devel,Qt5Gui-devel,Qt5Network-devel)
4. gcc or any other C compiler
5. gcc-c++ or any other C++ compiler
7. cmake
8. pwquality-devel( optional dependency used to measure the quality of a password when creating volumes )
9. libgcrypt-devel or libgcrypt11-dev
10. libsecret-devel or libsecret-1-dev( optional dependency to store keys in gnome's libsecret )
11. kde-devel( optional dependency to store keys in kde's kwallet )
12. pkg-config
13. lxqt_wallet-devel( optional dependency used for secure storage of keys.An internal copy of this project will be
   used if an external version is not present )
14. xdg-utils( runtime dependency used call a file manager to display contents of an unlocked volume.

To build SiriKali with default options,run these 5 commands from inside SiriKali source folder.

*****************************************************************************************************

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DQT5=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..

make -j$(nproc)

make install( or sudo make install )

*****************************************************************************************************

The build system now uses GNUInstallDirs (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/module/GNUInstallDirs.html), so pretty much all directories can be controlled properly.

available build options:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
This option tells the build process to install project's files in "/usr/".

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib
This option specifies the base directory where libraries should be installed. Normally, this is automatically detected.

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
This option tells the build process to build the project in release mode.This mode is most suitable for non developers.

-DNOSECRETSUPPORT=false
This option tells the build process to add gnome's libsecret secure storage of passwords.Set this option to "true" if
you do not want libsecret's support.

-DNOKDESUPPORT=false
This option tells the build process to add KDE's secure storage of passwords.Set this option to "true" if you do not
want KDE wallet support.

-DINTERNAL_LXQT_WALLET=false
This project depends on lxqt_wallet project and it ships with an internal copy of the project. Set this option to "true"
if you want SiriKali to unconditionally use the internal copy of the project or to "false" to make the build process
use a system installed version if found.

-DNONETWORKSUPPORT=true
This options tells the build process to add QNetwork support. Set this option to true if you do not want SiriKali to
connect to the internet to check for backend updates. SiriKali will not automatically connect to the internet
without user consent. This option was added because some versions of Qt crashes some versions of gcc
when encountering QNetworkAccessManager class.
